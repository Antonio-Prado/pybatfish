    "Finally, we want to make sure that our `to_outside` route policies don't announce any routes other than those that we own and those of our customers.  As you've figured out by now, the way to do that is to ask `searchRoutePolicies` to find a violation, which in this case is an accepted announcement that is neither for a prefix we own nor having the appropriate community tag for customers."

    "Above we use two parameters to `searchRoutePolicies` that you haven't seen yet:  the `complementPrefix` flag indicates that we are interested in prefixes outside the set specified by the `prefix` parameter, and the `complementCommunities` flag does the same thing for the `communities` parameter.  There are no results for `border1`'s `to_outside` policy, so Batfish has proven that the policy does not announce any routes other than those that either we own or are announced by our customers.  However, Batfish reports a violation for `border2`:  its route policy permits announcements for the prefix 1.2.2.0/23 when no communities are present.  A look at the configuration for that router identifies the problem:  its prefix list named `our-networks` accidentally allows prefixes of 1.2.3.0 with lengths 23 and higher instead of 24 and higher."
